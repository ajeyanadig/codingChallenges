Coding Challenge #2 -> THE BONUS ONE
Let's continue with our football betting app! Keep using the 'game' variable from before.
Your tasks:
1. Loopoverthegame.scoredarrayandprinteachplayernametotheconsole, along with the goal number (Example: "Goal 1: Lewandowski")
2. Usealooptocalculatetheaverageoddandlogittotheconsole(Wealready studied how to calculate averages, you can go check if you don't remember)
3. Printthe3oddstotheconsole,butinaniceformattedway,exactlylikethis:
Odd of victory Bayern Munich: 1.33 Odd of draw: 3.25
Odd of victory Borrussia Dortmund: 6.5
Get the team names directly from the game object, don't hardcode them (except for "draw"). Hint: Note how the odds and the game objects have the same property names ðŸ˜‰
4. Bonus:Createanobjectcalled'scorers'whichcontainsthenamesofthe players who scored as properties, and the number of goals as the value. In this game, it will look like this:
     {
       Gnarby: 1,
       Hummels: 1,
       Lewandowski: 2

///STRINGS THERE'S A FUN QUESTION
/* 
Write a program that receives a list of variable names written in underscore_case and convert them to camelCase.

The input will come from a textarea inserted into the DOM (see code below), and conversion will happen when the button is pressed.

THIS TEST DATA (pasted to textarea)
underscore_case
 first_name
Some_Variable 
  calculate_AGE
delayed_departure

SHOULD PRODUCE THIS OUTPUT (5 separate console.log outputs)
underscoreCase      âœ…
firstName           âœ…âœ…
someVariable        âœ…âœ…âœ…
calculateAge        âœ…âœ…âœ…âœ…
delayedDeparture    âœ…âœ…âœ…âœ…âœ…

HINT 1: Remember which character defines a new line in the textarea ðŸ˜‰
HINT 2: The solution only needs to work for a variable made out of 2 words, like a_b
HINT 3: Start without worrying about the âœ…. Tackle that only after you have the variable name conversion working ðŸ˜‰
HINT 4: This challenge is difficult on purpose, so start watching the solution in case you're stuck. Then pause and continue!

Afterwards, test with your own test data!

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
